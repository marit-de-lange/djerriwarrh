                <h2>First Nations People</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The area now known as Melton lies at the meeting point of two major language groups within the Kulin Nation — the Wathaurong (Wadawurrung) to the west, and the Woiwurrung to the east. Both groups were made up of smaller clans, each with its own cultural identity and closely related language. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The area along the west bank of the Werribee River, in what is now Bacchus Marsh, was inhabited by the Marpeang-bulluk clan of the Wathaurong, while the Kurung-jang-balluk clan of the Woiwurrung inhabited the east bank. 
                    This suggests that the Kurung-jang-balluk were the primary Traditional Owners of the Djerriwarrh Creek area, which lies to the northeast of the upper Werribee river. 
                    Djerriwarrh Creek joins the Werribee River near present-day Hopetoun Park on the west side, with the Melton suburbs of Brookfield and Exford lying to the east and south. From there, the Werribee River flows directly into Melton Reservoir.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    <p>Following colonisation, many First Nations people were displaced from their Country due to the rapid expansion of European settlement. While early encounters between Aboriginal clans and settlers were sometimes marked by cooperation, relations soon deteriorated, often leading to violence, dispossession, and deep and lasting harm to First Nations communities.

                <h2>The bridge</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Djerriwarrh Creek Bridge was constructed between 1858 and 1859 as part of transport improvements along the route between Melbourne and Ballarat, an important route for early settlers and transport in the region. Its construction was necessary for the increasing movement of people and goods between the two towns. The Djerriwarrh Creek, colloquially also often referred to as Deep Creek, was a difficult waterway to cross due to the steep and deep cliffs. Historical reports tell of horses and wagons being smashed while trying to navigate the crossing. The bridge is built from locally quarried sandstone and features one round stone arch. It is one of the few surviving examples of its kind in Victoria.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For a century, the bridge served the local community and passing traffic. It remained in official use until 1960, when a new bridge was built nearby to accommodate modern vehicles and higher traffic volumes. After the original bridge was bypassed, it was restored in 1963 by the Country Roads Board, recognising its historical and structural value. Although no longer used for road traffic, the bridge still stands today and has become a local landmark. Many locals cherish childhood memories of visiting the bridge site with their families, making it a place of both historical and personal significance.

                <h2>The environment</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The natural setting around the Djerriwarrh Creek Bridge is also of ecological and geological interest. Native plant species found in the area include Fragrant Saltbush, Saloop, and Scruby Saltbush. Bull Mallee trees growing along the creek are remnants of the former Long Forest, which is now protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The road cutting to the north-east of the bridge, along the highway, is geologically significant. It clearly shows the layers of rock that form the foundation of the volcanic plain, including shale, Werribee Formation sediments, and more recent volcanic basalt.

                <h2>Current situation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have been visiting the Djerriwarrh Creek Bridge area regularly since 2018, and in all those years, I have never once seen the place free of litter or illegal dumping. Every time I go, there is something new dumped. Sometimes just small bits of rubbish, but more often even large items such as cars, furniture, mattresses, children’s toys and beds, clothes and shoes, garden waste, and even hazardous materials like asbestos. It is in the creek, around the parking area, along the roadside, everywhere.  
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    Unfortunately, this is not a recent problem. The oldest media reference I found is a <a href=https://meltonmoorabool.starweekly.com.au/uncategorized/1787293-no-respect-for-djerriwarrh-creek-bridge/2013 target="_blank">2013 local newspaper article</a>, already addressing the area as a dumping hotspot. In 2016, a community member organised a Clean Up Australia Day event (advertised in a local Facebook group). Just about two weeks later, new dumping had taken place. That story repeats itself again and again. People clean up and others come and trash it again. It is disheartening
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    Over the years, I have taken countless photos of the mess, partly to document the scale of the problem, and partly because it’s hard to believe unless you’ve seen it. The dumping is not just ugly, it is dangerous. It pollutes the creek, harms wildlife, and sometimes it causes actual damage to the historic bridge itself. The area should be a place where people can enjoy nature and learn about local history. Instead, it has become a dumping ground.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This problem is not just about rubbish. It speaks to deeper issues: a lack of community respect and environmental awareness, perhaps poor waste management, and the need for stronger awareness and connection to place. If people understood the value of this site, environmentally, historically, and culturally, I believe fewer would treat it like this.

        <div id="thesolution"><h2>The solution?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A small group of concerned community members from Bacchus Mars and Melton came together to co-found Djerriwarrh Creek and Bridge Community Inc (website coming soon!).
            We are still in the early stages and working on things like grant applications and fundraising. Our goal is to create a community-led effort to care for this place long-term: regular cleanups, educational activities, and building pride in the area’s cultural, environmental, and historical value. This place deserves better, and we are determined to make a difference.
